# M226_E-Banking
 
# Basic idea
 Ronnie and I (Alessio) have created an EBanking system. We were inspired by Twint 
 and ZKB.
 We wanted to make our ebanking user friendly and so we chose JavaFX. With the help of JavaFX the user interface can be made very friendly. 
 friendly, so that the user can find his way around very quickly. The ebanking should not have too many options, because this would take too long. 
 Ebanking can be extended and functions can be added. We have chosen a simple version. 
 Every ebanking has a login system, so we knew that this must be present. After that we wanted that you can send money of course, 
 so we added that. Of course we could extend the ebanking as much as we wanted.
 
 # Procedure
 1.   The first step was that we sat down together and created the use cases.
    It was important to know before what our project (program) must be able to do.
    
 2. after that we created a rough UML, so we know what classes we work with and what methods we need 
    and which methods we need, so that everything is available. 3.
       
 3. with the UML and our usecases we could start well into our project and start programming.
    With the help of Github you can collaborate very well without getting into each other's code.
    We had almost none but no merche conflicts.
    
 4. At the end we sat down to the documentation and created all the rest of the documents and finished the project.
